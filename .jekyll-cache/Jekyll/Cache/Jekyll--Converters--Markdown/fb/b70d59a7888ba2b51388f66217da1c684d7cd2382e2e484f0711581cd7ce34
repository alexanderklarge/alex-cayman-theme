I"«<p>As per this <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EktaZtz6DSPbzymjg/free-1-1-learning-coaching">EA forum post</a>, Iâ€™ve started doing a trial run of 1:1 coaching - as of writing this, I had my first session this morning and it went really well!</p>

<h3 id="archetypes">Archetypes:</h3>

<p>Based on the emails Iâ€™ve gotten so far, Iâ€™ve come up with 5 â€œarchetypesâ€ of the kind of people Iâ€™d coach: the plan is to have a different type of meeting for each so Iâ€™m not over- or under-explaining anything.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Brand new to metalearning</li>
  <li>Read some resources, not implemented</li>
  <li>Read some resources, early in implementation</li>
  <li>Intermerdiate metalearner</li>
  <li>Advanced metalearner</li>
</ol>
